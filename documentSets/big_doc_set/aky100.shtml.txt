
John McLoughlin was one of the most influential figures of the fur trade and
settlement periods of Pacific Northwest history. Chief Factor of the Columbia District of
the British Hudson's Bay Company, he reigned as a benevolent autocrat, befriended
Americans, and eventually became an American citizen at Oregon City. 
He was born in Quebec in 1784 and trained as a physician near Montreal. He
became a physician and traveled to the Northwest region in 1824 as a representative
of the Hudson Bay Company. Here he occupied the position of Chief Factor from 1825,
when the regional headquarters of the company was moved from old Fort Astoria to
Fort Vancouver, until his retirement in 1845.
During his reign as Chief Factor, Dr. John McLoughlin directed the operations of
the fur trade in all the country west of the Rocky Mountains and north of the California
line, as well as the more localized activities of agriculture, livestock raising, sawmilling,
flour milling, dairying, and salmon fishing. From 1825 to 1843, when the provisional
government was first established by the settlers in the Willamette Valley, he was the
undisputed governor of the vast area bounded by the Rocky Mountains on the east,
Mexican territory (California) on the south, the Pacific Ocean on the west and the
Russian settlements on the north.
Dr. John McLoughlin exercised control over the Indians of the region, welcomed
and provisioned missionaries and settlers, encouraged schools and church instruction
and for a number of years was the only medical practitioner in the region. His
contributions to the development of the Northwest region in general and the Oregon
country in particular make him truly deserving of the title by which he is often referred
to, “Father of the Oregon”
In 1857, the man who had ruled an empire two and a half times the size of Texas,
died broken and bitter. He was 75 at the time. Five years later, in an act of penitence,
the legislature of the new State of Oregon restored his land to his heirs.
