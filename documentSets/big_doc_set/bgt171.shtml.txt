Leprechauns Don't Play Basketball

Letter #4
Dear Mrs. Schafer:
The book Leprechauns Don't Play Basketball, is very good. It is about four kids that are trying to find out if their teacher is really a vampier and if their P.E. sub is really a leprechaun. Howies grandma is from Ireland, so he thought she would know a little about leprechauns. They find out that leprechauns can only be away for three days. Also, that the leprechauns stole a brooch from the vampier and then the vampier got it back, so now the leprechauns are trying to get the green brooch. Their teacher Mrs. Jeepers is the vampier who stole the green brooch and is wearing it around her neck, and Mr. O'Grady the P.E. sub is trying to get it. Finally, at the end he doesn't get it and leaves and he says that the school is not big enough for a leprechaun and a vampier.
My reaction to this book was, I really thought it was good. I loved this book because it was easy to read and understand. I would recommend this book to people who like short books. My favorite part was when Howie and them were talking to his grandma. The author did not use any writting styles.
My favorite character was Eddie. I liked the way he played all of his practical jokes. I think I would of reacted to the conflict the same, because I would of helped my homeroom teacher before my P.E. teacher.
