The case gets national attention and a lot of different organizations (Like the K.K.K) get involved. After a long trial, Carl Lee gets free, and everybody goes back to “normal” life in Clanton, Mississippi. 
A review for a paper:
Time to Kill, one of the best known novels of the last 15 years, is a courtroom drama by John Grisham, set in a small town in southern Mississippi. Jake Brigance, a young, white lawyer is hired by a murderer of two rapists who raped his daughter. Sound complicated? It is- the murderer is black and the rapists are (or were) white. Jake Brigance is given the impossible task of proving that Carl Lee Hailey, the black murderer, is innocent. Impossible, because of a mostly white county, because of the Ku Klux Klan which lives again in Clanton, because of a win-at-all costs prosecutor, because of the racism and hypocrisy of the Mississippi citizens and judicial system. This book illustrates how no matter how much the world tries to say they celebrate their diversity or look past the differences, you have to look no farther than a small Mississippi town to see how untrue this is.
