
Critical thinking would be important to the well being of our society for many reasons except for the fact that hardly anyone ever uses it. If people used critical thinking all the time society would be a very different place. People would actually think about what they were going to say and what it means before they said it. It would prevent a lot of conflict because people would stop themselves from saying ignorant and offensive things. 
Also people would not be as easily influenced by the media and other peoples opinions because they would think about the message behind them. Society as a whole is so quick to believe what the media and/or people of authority have to say that they hardly ever take the time to consider other options. People would be much more likely to form their own opinions and stick to them with information and facts to back it up. 
I think that people in society would get along better if they took the time to use critical thinking. Even though almost nothing but positive things would come out of everyone thinking critically it will never happen because of the way society is. People are much more likely to follow someone else’s opinion then to take the time to come up with their own.
