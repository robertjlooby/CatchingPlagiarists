
ESSAY OUTLINE FORM
Main (Controlling) Idea of the essay: 
Three main points of argument (1)(2)(3)
INTRODUCTION: [Introduction should start on a general level with lead-in statements and gradually focus in on the specific topic of the essay. In the introduction, the reader should find the main idea of the essay expressed in the thesis sentence. Also in the introduction, the reader should be able to tell what specific points about the main idea will be discussed and in what order they will be developed. The lead in statements could (1) make a striking assertion, (2) use a split anecdote ( a story that is begun in the introduction and is finished in the conclusion), (3) use an interesting detail, statistic, or quotation, or (4) ask a provocative question. The introduction should make the reader want to continue reading.]

Thesis (which includes points of argument):
BODY: [Each topic sentence should be a major point of argument which supports the thesis statement. Primary support sentences are general statements which support the topic sentence. The secondary support sentences (or concrete illustrations), which support the primary support sentences, provide specific details, quotes, statistics, or real-life examples.]

The conclusion could also contain the end of a split anecdote which would finish the story begun in the introduction. The wrap-up statement could contain insights of the essay writer, encourage the reader to take action, emphasize the importance of one of the points of argument, or create a solid sense of finality.]
