
Throughout our lives we have to deal with the changing emotions within us. Our emotions can sometimes be as unpredictable as the weather and yet we&#8217;ve all found uses for the phrase &#8220;I&#8217;m having a bad week.&#8221; More over, while life can be a roller coaster ride, it can seem at times that we have a string of fortunate or unfortunate luck. These shifting highs and lows that we experience are a mild form of melancholy. While Hamlet&#8217;s melancholy in the play is much more pronounced then that which most of us experience, it&#8217;s still effects us the same way as it does him. It&#8217;s usual to have weeks where everything seems to go wrong and your temperament changes from what could have been a lighted hearted, fun mood, to a dark, unpleasant mood. It can even seem at times that you&#8217;re about to go crazy, if one more bad thing happens to you. This situation resembles that of Hamlet.
