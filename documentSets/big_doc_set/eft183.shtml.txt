
As I sit here listening to it fall on my window sill I
feel a shade of darkness come over me. I walk outside to feel it falling on me. As I
life my face towards the heavens to feel it falling on me I have this dark
feeling of dred.
For me, rainy days and nights make me feel sad inside. I get depressed and want to
stay in the house in bed. Whenever it rains I usually come downstairs and
look out the window, only to see if my car is still in
front of my door.
As I stare at the sky, I think to myself, it's going to rain all day. But still,
I thought, the sun could shine anyway, bringing with it the spring flowers that smell so 
lovely, the green grass, the blue sky, and the white clouds. Oh well, just a thought. I close my curtains and go
back upstairs, I get back into bed and try to sleep. Sleep eludes me because I am thinking about things like life
death, and money.
It begins to pour and as the rain falls harder and hevier, I feel myself
begining to fall asleep. Rain is like life, it comes and stays a while. 
Rain is like death, when it's time to stop it knows. Rain is also like money,
when you have a lot of it, it pours.
I dream of the day when the rain will go away, but until 
that day, I will listen to its drops on my window pane.
