Shakespears The Tragedy of McBeth: Impact of Hallucinations
I believe that the hallucinations viewed by McBeth played an important part in the whole story. It was one of those important factors that determined the outcome. McBeth as a leader should show only strength and no signs of weakness is acceptable. McBeth’s judgment begins to deteriorate once he sees these hallucinations.
When McBeth sees a dagger floating and hovering above his head he is viewed by the rest of the characters in the room as a lunatic. This is not a feature a great leader is distinguished by. McBeth is characterized as a tragic hero and a tragic hero is one who has the potential of being a great leader but causes his own downfall by his own weakness. This is who McBeth is. In the play, McBeth is supposedly a cold-blooded murderer who would do anything to protect his throne. He should dare to slain a child and walk away without remorse. When McBeth murdered his own, Banquo, he did not show any sentiments in killing him. Which depicts McBeth as an evil king with no heart.
Later McBeth begins to see the ghost of Banquo. There in a room full of people he begins to speak to himself, or so the others think he is. Lady McBeth begins to think that her husband has lost it and when others see McBeth in this position they lose respect which brings McBeth to the ground. At the end McBeth reveals his weaker side at the battle when he confronts McDuff whom later slains McBeth. McBeth already saw his end coming as he had mentioned and I believe that McBeth could have won this battle if he wanted to. This is how these hallucinations affected McBeth and began to defeat him.
