The main objective of the video is showing the process of coming together and meeting in the middle between the farmer and environmentalist, just as it is titled, Common Ground. With our project being based on organic farming, we felt that this would be a helpful video for not only us, but the rest of the class to begin the understanding of alternative ways to farm the land without destroying it. Then, when we give our project presentation, there will be a prior understanding and knowledge on the subject
