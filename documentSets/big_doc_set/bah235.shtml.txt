
Dances with Wolves
April 5, 1863
I have arrived at my post and found it to be completely unmanned. Fort Sedgewick appears to have been abandoned for some time. I do not know what has happened to the men that were posted here, but I am anxious to hear from someone. Fort Sedgewick is my post, but I have no one to report to. I don't know what to do. I can only communicate if I leave, and I don't want to abandon my post. I have assigned myself cleanup duty, and will attempt to restore the supply house. It is a tough job for one man but I have plenty of time. All is quiet on the frontier.

Today I made contact with an Indian. He is the first man I have seen since my being here. He tried to steal my horse, when I appeared I spooked him and he ran off. I am sure there are many more in the area. I will begin to prepare for another visit, if troops don't arrive soon, all may be lost. I have decided to ration my goods. The missing replacement should be here anytime; it should not be too much longer. I have been patrolling the area day-to-day and have found nothing. Except there is a wolf who seems to interested in the activity here. If he arrives again tomorrow I will name him Two Socks for the milky white socks on both front paws.

Many things have happened since my last entry. The Indians have come to visit a few times and our meetings are friendly, though they are frustrating due to the language barrier. It is always the same two men who come; six or seven other warriors accompany them. One of them must be a warrior leader, he is very strong and fiery. The other is very quiet and I think wise. We have learned to speak a few words of each other's language, but not many. I also have visited their camp briefly. I was very excited to see how they lived and I enjoyed myself. I smoked their pipes with them, sat around the campfire, and then was escorted out by the quiet Indian. I look forward to another visit with my neighbors.

Today great progress was made with my neighbors. They have a white woman living in their camp named Stands With A Fist that can interprit my conversations with the Indians. I now know the name of the quiet Indian is Kicking Bird. They have named me Dances With Wolves. I now know what questions the Indians are asking me and the same for them. The quiet one and I have become good friends. He is constantly asking me if more white man will come into these lands. I just cannot bring myself to tell him. I feel that our relationship will only grow stronger.

So much has happened since my last entry; I don't know where to begin. I now can speak the language of my neighbors thanks to the teaching of Stands With A Fist.
It took me quite a while but I am pleased with how fast I am learning. I have been spending much more time with my neighbors and I have been able to learn much more about them. Last conversation Kicking Bird and I had, he asked again about more white men coming. I told him there would be more white man than the stars; the color went out of his face and he looked lifeless. I am sorry for telling him.
