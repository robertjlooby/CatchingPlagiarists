
In A Vindication of the Rights of Women Mary Wollstonecraft wanted to point out the indifferences women faced at that period in time. In the her work of literature she stated, &#8220;they are treated as a kind of subordinate beings, and not as part of the human species,&#8221; In this point in time women could never of gained their independence they were ruled by society itself. They had to adhere to certain standards as if it was a rule and if they broke it they were punished. 
Women were seen as inferiors to men. They weren&#8217;t allowed to get an education or even have their own ideas. The character of women in my opinion was falsified as if they had to repress their desires and goals in life. Like a mask put on and not allowed to take it off until your total existence as an individual ceases to exist. 
I think that the way women were treated contributed to a change. This type of change would create assertiveness in freethinking. A beginning that can lead to a woman standing up for what she believes is true. Independence and strength was needed. Society needed to see that the qualities in women were of a maternal nature as well as a prominent stature of independence. Ideas and rules should not be forced into a person brain. Women aren&#8217;t puppets or dolls to be moved or put in a place of limit in their own existence in life. Limits should never exist in an individual&#8217;s life. What shall remain vital is knowledge and &#8220;intellect&#8221; in order to decisions in life as an independent unique individual.
