
In The Crucible by Arthur Miller, some of the characters showed courage when
the live’s of their loved ones were at risk. 
One of the main character’s in the play was John Proctor. He showed courage
when his wife, Elizabeth was accused of being a witch. When John found out that it was
Abigail Williams, John’s mistress, who accused Elizabeth he said, “Fear nothing. I’ll find
Ezekial Cheever. I’ll tell him that it was all sport.”(p.61, Proctor). Being it was Abigail
who had accused Elizabeth made it difficult for John. John and Elizabeth had a very
heated argument about Abigail. She believed that Abigail was out to kill her. She said to
John, “Spoke or silent, a promise is surely made. And she may dote on it now - I am sure
she does - and thinks to kill me, then to take my place.”(p.61, Elizabeth). John doesn’t
seem to think that Abigail would do such a terrible thing to Elizabeth. Elizabeth says, “It
is her dearest hope, John, I know it. There be a thousand names; why does she call mine? 
There be a certain danger in calling such a name - I am no Goody Good that leeps in
ditches, nor Osburn, drunk and half-witted. She’d dare not call out such a farmer’s wife
but there be monstrous profit in it. She thinks to take my place, John.”(p.61, Elizabeth) 
Elizabeth also said, “You’ll tear it free - when you come to know that I will be your only
wife, or no wife at all! She has an arrow in you yet, John Proctor, and you know it
well!”(p.62, Elizabeth) Another issue that made it difficult for John to prove Elizabeth
was innocent was that John did not attend church.
