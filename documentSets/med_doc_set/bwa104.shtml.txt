In search of material goods, Novalee dreams of a house for her family. Novalee does not wish for large mansions, extravagant cars or designer clothes.

Willy Jack pursues enormous wealth at the sacrifice of his health. His first moneymaking scheme had him headed for California. Where he heard his cousin J. Paul had made a lot of money working for Union Pacific Railroad. However, J. Paul wealth was a workers compensation payment for the baby finger he lost while working. Willy Jack intended on sacrificing his baby finger as well. For Willy Jack, a southpaw, the little finger of his right hand was absolutely useless. And it was the one he would sacrifice, the one he intended to trade for greyhounds and race horses. Page 10.

Willy Jack never achieves his dreams of wealth. His failure is a result of the poor selfish decisions he makes along the way. Nonetheless, the end of the novel gives the reader a sense of hope for Willy Jack. He is able to admit he made bad decisions and most importantly he learns that happiness is found in his heart, not in his wallet.
