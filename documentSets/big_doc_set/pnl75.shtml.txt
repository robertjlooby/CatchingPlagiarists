
The questions posed to me are what I think of Human Psychology and the views of Dr. Buscaglia. My answers are no where near as easy as the questions. I don't know very much about Human Psychology, but from what I do know I think it is a great way to learn about people. I feel this way because I believe the self is a very important part of life. Dealing with a persons troubles in a conscious way will help them learn to deal with it on their own.
On the later subject I am very well informed. I saw this video once in High School and it still gives me goose bumps. I do agree with Dr. Buscaglia on his views. His ideas sound wonderful, but we must be realistic. Our world doesn't work that way. Some people are really nice and do care, but others love pity. They play on others to build themselves up. Love is a gift and should be cherished, but I do believe that it would take ages to create the kind of love he is talking about. It is a very slim chance that it will ever happen. If you look, throughout history, as long as there have been people there has been hate. Those rotten few have and will always ruin it for the rest. It is not their fault, not their parent, grandparent and so on. It’s human nature to hate crave greed lust and other such sins. We don’t mean to be like that it’s just the way we are. There is no good without evil, no light without dark, and no love without . If our species accepts that, we might be able to get a foothold on true love.
