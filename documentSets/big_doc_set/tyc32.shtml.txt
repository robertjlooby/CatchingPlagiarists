
Having a job in high school gives me an edge. As an employee, I have
learned to interact with many different types of people, work together,
and learn the value of a dollar. Being employed is one of the best things
that has ever happened to me. Participating in a job has offered me many
opportunities to make friends, assume a leadership role, and take on
responsibilities. 
Working has enabled me to become a more mature and well-rounded
individual. Without a job, I would not be who I am today. When you are
employed, you have to work every other day in order to make money, and
it becomes apparent that you do not have all the time in the world to
accomplish every day tasks like homework or athletics. 
With so much going on in a high- schoolers life, it is essential to
prioritize. Participation in a job has helped me learn to do just that. By
keeping an organized schedule of my responsibilities, and using my time
well, I have been able to show my peers that it is possible to accomplish
what needs to be done. 
At school and at work, people look up to me for advice. Just
knowing that others see how hard you work to get things done in your own
life makes the world of difference in how you feel about yourself.
Despite the number of hours I have dedicated to my job, I have been
able to maintain a B average. I have learned that if something is
important to you, you can accomplish whatever you want to. 
My participation in the world of working has made all the
difference to me. Working plays a key role in many students lives. 
Participation in employment has given me a sense of maturity and has
made me feel good about myself. It has made a difference in my life, and
I am sure in many other lives, too.
