
Margaret Johnson, only daughter of Mary Murphy: found dead in the East River at age 23
Margaret Johnson, also called Maggie, was a successful seamstress and the only daughter of Mary Murphy died on November 19 in the East River where she was spotted floating atop the freezing cold water.
The cause of death seems to be suicide due to a longing case of depression but there are still tests being done on the body. Because of the poverty Maggie was born into she did not have the chance to learn how to swim which leads to the thought of her getting hypothermia once she either jumped or got pushed in the river.
Maggie was said to be a very intelligent young lady who was always very popular around the men. She was also said to be very dependent and that was clearly seen when she ran away from home and went straight to a guy friend of hers whose name will not be released. As soon as they realized their differences she quickly ran back home to her mother who then rejected her, claiming that she was the “devil.”
Earlier in her short, prosperous life Maggie had to deal with the death of both her baby brother and her father, the one close family member that protected her in tough times that she often encountered.
Margaret Johnson is survived by a brother Jimmie Johnson and her mother Mary Murphy.
