
Economics assignment: APEC
When the ‘Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation” (APEC) was established in 1989 in response to the 
growing interdependence among Asia-Pacific economies, its goal was to advance Asia-Pacific economic 
dynamism and sense of community. When the cooperation was established, there were 12 founding 
member economies, namely Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Canada, Indonesia, Japan, Republic of Korea, 
Malaysia, New Zealand, Republic of the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and the United States. Since then 
there has been more countries/economies joining APEC. APEC has come a long way since 1989. It has 
built steadily on the efforts of the past and looks forward to further positive progress. The initial years of 
APEC were focused largely on exchange of views and project based initiatives. As needs of the member 
economies has evolved into a forum of higher purpose: to build the Asia-Pacific community through 
achieving economic growth and development through trade and economic cooperation. In the Osaka 
meeting in 1994, APEC leaders adopted the Osaka Action Agenda, which firmly established three pillars of 
APEC activities: Trade and investment liberalization, business facilitation and economic-technical 
cooperation. Its main objective is to develop a region-wide, free trade and investment regime by the year 
2000. APEC operates by consensus. In 1991, members committed themselves to conducting their activities 
and work programs on the basis of open dialogue with equal respect for the views of all participants.
The APEC chair, which rotates annually among members, is responsible for hosting the annual ministerial 
meeting of foreign and economic ministers. At the 1989 Canberra Ministerial Meeting, it was agreed that it 
would be appropriate that every alternative ministerial meeting be held in an ASEAN economy/country. 
Senior Official Meeting (SOM) are held regularly prior to every ministerial meeting. APEC senior officials 
make recommendations to the ministers and carry out their decisions. They oversee and coordinate, with 
approval from Ministers, the budgets and work programs of the APEC for a.
Mr. Fischer, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, said Australia’s IAP (Individual Action Plan) 
would address the main trade liberalization issues of tariffs, non- tariffs, investment and services, although 
the 1996 IAP would not pre-judge the outcomes of the existing and previously announced reviews into the 
passenger motor vehicle, textile clothing and footwear and sugar sectors. Other elements of the IAP deal 
wit the important trade facilitation issues such as standards and customs procedures, intellectual property 
rights, competition policy, and mobility of business people and deregulation. 
“Australia’s plan is fully consistent with the general principals of the Osaka Action Agenda agreed by that 
leaders in November 1995, including comprehensives,” Mr. Fischer said. “Australia’s done a great deal to 
liberalize our market consistent with APEC goals, and we expect others to match our record. The 
government will pursue vigorously Australian trade and investment priorities within APEC,” Mr. Fischer 
stated.
Australia’s IAP address the objectives and guidelines of the Osaka Action Plan in a comprehensive manner:

Services
Australia is committed to further liberalize the business services, communication, transport, financial 
services and energy sectors including to:
Telecommunications: Introduce full and open competition from 1 July and privatize 1/3 of 
Telstra with 35% of the float available to foreign investors.
Transport: Windback maratime cabotage protection by year 2000 and discontinue schemes which 
provide financial incentives for certain Australian vessels. In aviation, Australia will progressively 
liberalize access to the market for freight and passengers and ensure airlines are free to set fares in 
response to market conditions.
There are many other IAP’s in Australia’s list, however these were some of the main IAP’s.
Why is APEC important? APEC is taking on strategic significance internationally for a number of reasons:
&#61623; It acts as a forum between Asia and the Americans. The 18 countries of PAEC represent 56% of the world’s gross national product and 46% of all trade. Historically, contention between Japan and the United States over Asia cumulated in the outbreak of the Second World War in the pacific.
&#61623; APEC is gaining momentum as one of the world’s centers for trade and liberalization discussions. 
&#61623; All three Chinas (Taiwan, Hong Kong and the people’s republic) are participants in APEC. The reversion of Hong Kong to China in 1997 is a historic change, which brought regional stability within APEC.
&#61623; Asian immigration to Canada has been increasing in recent years. The growing population of Asian descent in Canada, particularly in Vancouver, means heightened awareness and interest in Asian-Pacific affairs.
The international called APEC is a great force in today’s business. It is a thriving force, which will be 
around for many years to come. The effectiveness of this organization is extremely great, as it will benefit 
many people throughout the world, in all areas of business.
