
Case Study : Media ups and downs
Summary:
&#61623; The Australian made midday television program “Day time with Amanda” first aired in 1993, showing good ratings and high advertising revenue during its early stages.
&#61623; Became a well known program dominating its allocated timeslot, with loyal viewers.
&#61623; Target market for program are older mature females. The younger females are attracted to the American talkshow competition.
&#61623; Presenter Amanda Stanton is a key strength, attracting and holding viewers.
Key Issues:
&#61623; Advertising revenue for the program is declining. Due to the fact that the target market of the program are non income earners (program is screened during working day), advertisers are deciding to promote else where. Advertisers are becoming more innovative in promotion ideas.
&#61623; Competition is intensifying. The programs rating are declining and viewers are being attracted elsewhere.
Recommendation:
I believe serious changes must be implemented to ensure the future success of the television program. Firstly, the target market which it addresses. Research on what viewers want to see, and why they are being attracted elsewhere must be sought. The program has a large audience on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays – why not the other days? The perception of the show needs to be refreshed.
